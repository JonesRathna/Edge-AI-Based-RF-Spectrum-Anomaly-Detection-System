# Edge-AI Based RF Spectrum Anomaly Detection System

## Problem Statement
Unauthorized RF transmissions and spectrum misuse can disrupt critical communication systems such as aviation, defense, and telecom networks. Existing detection solutions are expensive, centralized, and slow, making them unsuitable for real-time monitoring and rapid response.

## Objective
To develop a real-time Edge-AI system that continuously monitors RF signals, detects anomalous patterns instantly, and alerts operators to potential interference or unauthorized transmissions.

## Functional Requirements
- Capture RF signals using a Software Defined Radio (SDR)
- Convert signals into frequency-domain data using FFT
- Analyze signal patterns using a machine learning model
- Detect anomalies in real time
- Classify type of interference or signal source
- Send alerts to monitoring dashboard
- Upload logs and signal data to cloud storage

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Low latency detection and response
- Scalable architecture for multi-location deployment
- Cost-efficient hardware implementation
- Reliable and accurate anomaly detection
- Secure communication between edge and cloud

## Stakeholders
- Telecom operators
- Defense communication systems
- Airport communication authorities
- Network monitoring engineers
- Public infrastructure agencies

## Expected Outcome
A real-time intelligent monitoring system capable of detecting abnormal RF activity, identifying interference sources, and preventing communication failures to improve reliability and safety of wireless systems.
